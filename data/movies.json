Just two days after his death, as his maid servant was bringing his only Son SUDHIR to Champa Nagar by train the child disappeared on the way. Hardly could the shock of this news subside, when one stormy night his nephew Jugal and sister's son Shekhar came together to  \"MOTI MAHAL\" to hear the WILL from Vakil. But Lo! the Vakil himself vanished and his dead body was picked up in the palace-compound, sometime later.",

Moti suffers when he is told by Bina’s father (Sankantha) that she is dead, while Leela’s father (Pande) enjoins his daughter to commit suicide if Moti does not marry her. In spite of the film’s endorsement of ‘traditional’, lethally oppressive patriarchal mores, incarnated by the women’s fathers, Mehboob’s narrative at least dares to depict a woman who refuses to feel guilty about her desire.",
